Feature: Medication available in the pharmacy
    As a Pharmacist
    I want to maintain a list of medications we have in our formulary
    So that we know the medications we can dispense to our patients

    # Assumptions
    # 1. The name of a medication acts as its unique identifier
    # 2. Medication cannot be added to the formulary more than once

    Scenario: Ability to add the name of a medication to the formulary

    Scenario: Ability to return a list of medication names in the formulary


        Examples:
            | Name        | Strength | Size |
            | Amoxicillin | 250mg    | 20   |
            | Codeine     | 30mg     | 10   |
            | Diclofenac  | 250mg    | 25   |
            | Ibuprofen   | 500mg    | 50   |
            | Paracetamol | 500mg    | 50   |
            | Simvastatin | 10mg     | 10   |
            | Tramadol    | 50mg     | 100  |
